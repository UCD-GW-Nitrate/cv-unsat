# Central Valley Unsaturated zone travel time
In this repository we provide information and the data for the estimation of the unsaturated travel time in Central Valley

# Methodology
The travel time $\tau$ assuming vertical water movement can be estimated by the following equation:

$$\tau = \theta_m \frac{D_{gw}}{R}$$

where $\theta_m$  is the deep vadose zone water content or mobile water content $[L^3/L^3]$, $D_{gw}$ is the depth from soil surface to the water table $[L]$ and $R$ is the groundwater recharge $[L/T]$
